What is needed from me.
Risks? Long term risks?
What the timeline would look like? I am going out of the country in about a month for 2 weeks.
Any financial costs to me?
Recovery period?
Changes in diet?
Anything I can do on my end to increase the success rate for the patient?
Location of the treatment?

Armen, We have told you before many times that we would file eviction. A copy
of the papers for you had been given to Andrea on the evening of Sunday,
7/22/2023, to be passed to you. Another copy addressed to you has also been
mailed to 1133 Central Blvd, Hayward. Since you now claimed "I was never served
any papers.", we repeat our prior requests to to set up an an appointment with
you. There are some 40+ pages of documents with lots of details. Please respond
with an appointment time and location.

Armen, you know about the eviction lawsuit and you keep saying "not served". Ignoring this is not a responsible way to deal with it. Please reply with an appointment date and time. We have the papers ready for you, case number 23CV038260.
